# Check-In Schedule

For the Project 2 sprint, each student will have two check-ins with Kate.

Please make sure to note when your appointments are so you will be prepared with questions!

If you would like to switch to a different time, you may ask another student to switch with you. 

*If you choose not to use your check-in, please let Kate know so she can help other students during that time.*
